# Chapter 6: Rhythmancy Magic Items

This section provides an assortment of magic items with ties to rhythmancy. The **Rhythmancy Magic Items** table lists the magic items in this section along with their rarity and whether they require Attunement.

## Magic Item Category: Instruments

This document introduces a new category of magic items: instruments.

### Instruments

Magic instruments function as regular musical instruments, but are imbued with additional arcane properties. Often such instruments provide access to rhythmantic songs, or enhance a rhythmancer's existing abilities.

When used in worlds and settings where "instrument" does not exist as a magic item category, such magic items also count as wondrous items. Similarly, a wondrous item that can function as a musical instrument, such as the _Pipes of the Sewers_, also counts as an instrument magic item, as long as the wielder meets the item's proficiency requirements to play it.

##### Rhythmancy Magic Items

| Magic Item | Category | Rarity | Requires Attunement |
|:-----------|:---------|:-------|:--------------------|
| _[Instrument of the Wild](#instrument-of-the-wild)_ | Instrument | Varies | Yes (by someone able to cast rhythmancy spells) |
| _[Maracas of Holding](#maracas-of-holding)_ | Instrument | Rare | Yes |

## Magic Item Descriptions

The magic items are presented in alphabetical order.

### Instrument of the Wild

_Instrument (Any), Rarity Varies (Requires Attunement by Someone Able to Cast Rhythmancy Spells)_

This instrument was lovingly crafted by an artist with a profound connection to the rhythm of the natural world, and they have imbued some of their own magic into the craft and design. The instrument manifests the magical gift of its creation as one or more rhythmancy spells. It also contains charges that can be spent to cast these spells at a cost of one charge per spell level. The number of charges vary based on its rarity. The instrument regains 1d4 expended charges at dawn.

An _Instrument of the Wild_ contains one or more spells based on its number of charges and rarity, and an instrument of a higher rarity also includes the spells from all rarities below it (for example, an uncommon _Instrument of the Wild_ includes both _The Lost is Found_ and _Song of Discovery_). At the Dungeon Master's discretion, some of these instruments can be found with replacement imbued spells from the ranger spell list; such spells are a reflection of the person who crafted the instrument and the magical properties they imparted to it, and they are considered rhythmancy spells for the purpose of casting by expending charges.

##### Instrument of the Wild Rarity
| Charges | Rhythmancy Spell    | Rarity    |
|:-------:|:--------------------|:----------|
| 1       | _The Lost is Found_ | Common    |
| 2       | _Song of Discovery_ | Uncommon  |
| 3       | _Wind's Requiem_    | Rare      |
| 4       | _Earth God's Lyric_ | Very Rare |
| 5       | _Song of Healing_   | Legendary |

### Maracas of Holding

_Instrument (Maracas), Rare (Requires Attunement)_

These maracas are filled with dried seeds that clatter when the instruments are shaken, and they seem to have an endless capacity for more seeds.

The _Maracas of Holding_ contain 3 charges. While you are Attuned to the _Maracas of Holding_, you can expend its charges to create one of the following magical effects:

- You can expend 1-3 charges to cast a rhythmancy spell you know at a cost of one charge per spell level. The maracas regain all charges expended for casting spells at dawn.
- You can expend 1 charge and perform a dance with the maracas for 1 minute to magically imbue a nonmagical bag, backpack, or similar storage item you touch with increased storage capacity, temporarily turning the item into a magic item with the storage properties of a _bag of holding_.

  If the maracas have no charges remaining when you perform this dance, one of the items of your choice that was transformed in this manner is reverted to its original nonmagical form, at which point anything still inside its interior in excess of its normal capacity is expelled. You can restore 1 charge to the maracas by touching an item you transformed in this manner to revert it as a Magic action. Ending Attunement to the _Maracas of Holding_ causes all such items you transformed to be reverted and restores all of the maracas' charges spent for such transformations.
