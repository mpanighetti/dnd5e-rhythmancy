# Chapter 3: Rhythmancy Classes

This chapter presents new subclasses with abilities centered around the use of rhythmancy magic:

- **[College of Legends](#college-of-legends-bard):** A Bard who enhances magic with musical performance

- **[Reveler](#reveler-fighter):** A Fighter who dances to the rhythm of magical song

- **[Warrior of Song](#warrior-of-song-monk):** A Monk imparting ancient knowledge through oral tradition

- **[Wild Composer](#wild-composer-ranger):** A Ranger who crafts magical instruments to share the music of nature

## College of Legends (Bard)

_Recall Lost Knowledge in Magical Song_

> "My teacher always advised me to write songs that transport the listener to the moment in time you're singing of. Now… I finally feel I understand what he meant… and the true power of music."
>
> — Kass, _The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild_

Though all bards have the ability to learn rhythmancy spells, practitioners of the College of Legends have built entire careers out of unlocking the magic sealed within these songs. These maestros are often sought out as teachers to aid new students in their rhythmantic studies, passing on what they learned from their own masters of the craft.

### Level 3: Legendary Recall

You have extensively pored through history books and sought out hidden knowledge of ancient heroes and their adventures. You gain Proficiency in two skills of your choice from the following list: Arcana, History, Nature, or Religion. Additionally, when you take the Study action, you can expend one use of Bardic Inspiration; roll the Bardic Inspiration die, and add the number rolled to the d20.

### Level 3: Rhythmantic Savant

You have an innate understanding of the magic of music and how to modify your compositions. When you cast a level 1+ Rhythmancy spell targeting one or more creatures, you can select one target of the spell and modify your musical performance to enhance the spell using one of the following effects (in addition to the spell's normal effects). The enhancement succeeds only if one of the following conditions are met: the target is willing; the target is hit by an attack roll triggered by the spell; or the target fails a saving throw triggered by the spell.

- _**Abjurative Melody.**_ The target receives a number of Temporary Hit Points equal to a roll of your Bardic Inspiration die.
- _**Enchanting Tune.**_ The target has the Charmed condition until the end of your next turn. You cannot select this effect if the spell you cast is already capable of granting the Charmed condition.
- _**Evocative Beat.**_ The target takes Thunder damage equal to a roll of your Bardic Inspiration die.

Once you enhance a spell with one of the selected effects, you regain the ability to select that enhancement when you finish a Long Rest, or by expending one use of Bardic Inspiration.

### Level 6: Inner Song

You can channel your song to temporarily boost the power of your rhythmantic magic. At the end of a Long Rest, you can expend one use of Bardic Inspiration to roll a Bardic Inspiration die and gain a number of temporary Rhythmancy Points equal to the number rolled. While you have these temporary Rhythmancy Points, they can be spent to cast or learn spells as if they were normal Rhythmancy Points, but they don't count toward your total number of Rhythmancy Points to determine the highest level of Rhythmancy spell you can cast or learn. Any unspent temporary Rhythmancy Points disappear after you finish your next Long Rest.

### Level 6: Speed Training

Whenever you learn a new song through rhythmantic training, you bypass all training requirements, including finding a teacher, all training costs and issues, and any time requirements. Instead, you learn the Rhythmancy spell as a Magic action and by expending either a spell slot of a level greater than or equal to the spell's level, or that number of Rhythmancy Points (for cantrips, expend either a level 1 spell slot or 1 Rhythmancy Point). You cannot learn a Rhythmancy spell in this manner if you do not have an appropriate spell slot or sufficient Rhythmancy Points available to expend.

### Level 14: Legendary Secrets

You have mastered unlocking hidden or lost ancient secrets. You always have the _Legend Lore_ spell prepared. You can cast it once without expending a spell slot, and you regain the ability to do so when you finish a Long Rest. When you cast _Legend Lore_ using this feature, you can cast it as an action rather than its normal casting time, and you ignore its Material component requirements. You can also cast _Legend Lore_ normally using a spell slot of the appropriate level.

## Reveler (Fighter)

_Fuel Attacks with Musical Energy_

Though skilled in the art of martial combat, Revelers also engage in studies of musical composition and kinetic performance, aided by channeling rhythmantic magic. Rather than dividing their focus, these shared disciplines complement each other, leading to Fighters gifted with fluent movement on the battlefield and equal command of the dance floor.

### Level 3: Rhythmancy Champion

You have studied magical songs and learned how to call upon them in the heat of battle. You gain the following benefits.

_**Cantrips.**_ You know three cantrips: _True Strike_ and two other cantrips of your choice from the Bard spell list.

Whenever you gain a Fighter level, you can replace one of your cantrips, except _True Strike_, with another Bard cantrip of your choice.

When you reach Fighter level 10, you learn another Bard cantrip of your choice.

_**Rhythmancy Points.**_ You gain 2 Rhythmancy Points to spend on casting Rhythmancy spells. You can cast Bard spells using Rhythmancy Points even if they aren't Rhythmancy spells.

_**Prepared Spells of Level 1+.**_ You prepare the list of level 1+ spells that are available for you to cast with this feature. To start, choose two level 1 Bard spells.

If another Reveler feature gives you spells that you always have prepared, those spells don't count against the number of spells you can prepare with this feature, but those spells otherwise count as Bard spells for you.

_**Changing Your Prepared Spells.**_ Whenever you gain a Fighter level, you can replace one spell on your list with a level 1 or level 2 Bard spell.

_**Spellcasting Ability.**_ Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your Bard spells.

_**Instrument Training.**_ You gain Proficiency with a Musical Instrument of your choice.

_**Spellcasting Focus.**_ You can use a Musical Instrument as a Spellcasting Focus for your Bard spells.

### Level 3: Bravado

Thanks to your practice at performing in front of audiences, you gain the following benefits.

- You gain Proficiency in the Performance skill.
- You can channel the raw charisma of your performance when you attempt certain tasks; when you make an ability check using one of the following skills, you can expend 1 Rhythmancy Point to make it as a Charisma check even if it normally uses a different ability: Animal Handling, Insight, Sleight of Hand, or Stealth. When you use this ability, your Charisma represents your command over others, honing your ability to be seen or unseen to achieve your goals.

### Level 7: Blade Staccato

You fight to the rhythm of your song, attempting to overwhelm your foes with multiple attacks. When you cast _True Strike_, its duration changes to 1 minute, and its benefits are applied to all weapon attacks you make for the duration. The spell ends early if you miss an attack.

### Level 10: Diagetic Surge

You draw energy from the music that churns through your veins. When you expend a use of either your Action Surge or Second Wind, in addition to the feature's normal effects, you regain two expended Rhythmancy Points.

### Level 15: Duet Maestro

When you cast a Bard spell targeting only yourself, you can also affect one willing ally with the spell if the ally is within 10 feet of you. Additionally, you can cast a Duet spell even if you do not have the spell prepared, as long as the other participant in the duet has the spell prepared and does not also have this class feature.

### Level 18: Pitch Perfect

Through intensive rehearsal, you have perfected your favorite compositions and can readily perform them with no preparation. Choose one of the level 1 Bard spells you have prepared that has a casting time of an action. You can cast this spell at its lowest level without expending Rhythmancy Points.

Additionally, when you take the Attack action on your turn, you can replace one of the attacks with a casting of the spell you chose for this feature.

Whenever you finish a Long Rest, you can replace the spell you chose for this feature with a different level 1 Bard spell you have prepared with a casting time of an action.

## Warrior of Song (Monk)

_Impart Wisdom through Ancient Melody_

> Time passes, people move, like a river's flow, it never ends. A childish mind will turn to noble ambition. Young love will become deep affection. The clear water's surface reflects growth. Now listen to the serenade of water and reflect upon yourself.
>
> — Sheik, _The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time_

In some monasteries, a single Monk will choose to train as a Warrior of Song, acting as the keeper of the organization's sacred techniques and communal knowledge. This individual knows when to keep such information—often encoded within rhythmantic compositions and poems—under their careful watch, and when to share this knowledge with heroes who would use it to strike down the great evils threatening the order of the world.

### Level 3: Keeper of Secrets

You have been trained to act as a living compendium of ancient knowledge, and can recite it on command. You gain Proficiency in a skill of your choice from the following list: Arcana, History, Nature, or Religion. You also have Expertise in the chosen skill. Whenever you finish a Long Rest, you can replace the selected skill with another skill of your choice from the above list, as you study your long memory and resurface other ancient secrets of song.

### Level 3: Rhythmancy Warrior

You have engaged in the study of magic song and incorporated it into your combat training. You gain the following benefits.

_**The Royal Decree.**_ Among the secrets you keep is a deep-seated authority granted to your monk sect by ancient royal families. You know _[The Royal Decree](ch-5-rhythmancy-spells.md#the-royal-decree)_ spell. You can spend one Focus Point to cast it without any Verbal or Material components, bypassing the Musical Instrument requirement by lacing the music's magic seamlessly into your words.

_**Musical Mind.**_ You can cast level 1 Bard spells you have prepared, including Rhythmancy songs, by spending 1 Focus Point. You can spend additional Focus Points to increase the level of a Bard spell that you cast, provided that the spell has an enhanced effect at a higher level. The spell's level increases by 1 for each additional Focus Point you spend.

The maximum number of Focus Points you can spend to cast a spell in this way (including its base Focus Point cost and any additional points you spend to increase its level) equals half your Monk level (round down).

_**Prepared Level 1 Spells.**_ You prepare the list of level 1 spells that are available for you to cast with this feature. To start, choose three level 1 Bard spells.

If another Warrior of Song feature gives you spells that you always have prepared, those spells don't count against the number of spells you can prepare with this feature, but those spells otherwise count as Bard spells for you.

_**Changing Your Prepared Spells.**_ Whenever you gain a Monk level, you can replace one spell on your list with another level 1 Bard spell.

_**Spellcasting Ability.**_ Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your Bard spells.

_**Instrument Training.**_ You gain Proficiency with a Musical Instrument of your choice.

_**Spellcasting Focus.**_ You can use a Musical Instrument as a Spellcasting Focus for your Bard spells.

### Level 6: Shared Story

When you find a worthy ally, you can impart a portion of your wisdom to aid them on their quest. As a Magic action, you can expend one Focus Point and touch a willing creature to grant it the ability to cast one Rhythmancy spell of your choice that you have prepared. It can cast this spell by expending the required number of your Focus Points, or by using a spell slot of the appropriate level or sufficient Rhythmancy Points it possesses. The creature must be on the same plane of existence as you to cast one of your spells in this manner. The spell uses your spellcasting ability and Proficiency Bonus when the target casts it.

This effect lasts until either the creature casts your spell or you finish a Long Rest. You can also end the effect at any time (no action required).

### Level 6: Vanish

As part of your training in ancient arts of secret-keeping, you know how to make a quick exit. You always have the _Misty Step_ spell prepared and can cast it by spending 1 Focus Point. Additionally, you can choose to cast _Misty Step_ as a Reaction triggered when a creature you can see hits you with an attack, causing the attack to miss.

### Level 11: Songs of Travel

You have learned secret songs that enable instantaneous long-distance travel. You always have the _Dimension Door_ and _[Space Warp](ch-5-rhythmancy-spells.md#space-warp)_ spells prepared. You can spend 5 Focus Points to cast either spell once without any Material components. Once you cast each spell using Focus Points, you regain the ability to do so when you finish a Long Rest.

### Level 17: Music-Empowered Strikes

You have learned how to weave arcane effects into your attacks. Once per turn, when you make an Unarmed Strike, in place of the normal options for its effect, you can cast a spell you have prepared. The spell must have a casting time of an action and a range of either touch or self.

## Wild Composer (Ranger)

_Share Nature's Song in Magic Instruments_

> "You know there's rhythm all around us: the waves break in rhythm, people walk in rhythm, people breathe in rhythm, too. People work in rhythm! The whole world is made up of rhythm."
>
> — Victor Brady, _[Let's Go Play to the Rhythm of the World](https://youtu.be/g1zNAbrU1zM)_

Rangers who walk the path of the Wild Composer are drawn to the innate music present in the natural world. They revel in the melody of leaves rustling in the wind like chimes, and play along as woodpeckers drum a steady beat on tall steadfast trees. To these adventurers, the wild itself has a breath and cadence that grants those who can hear it great wisdom.

### Level 3: Wild Composer Spells

When you reach a Ranger level specified in the Wild Composer Spells table, you thereafter always have the listed spells prepared.

#### Wild Composer Spells

| Ranger Level | Spells |
|:------------:|:-------|
| 3  | _[The Hawk's Call](ch-5-rhythmancy-spells.md#the-hawks-call)_, _[The Lost is Found](ch-5-rhythmancy-spells.md#the-lost-is-found)_ |
| 5  | _[No Stone Unturned](ch-5-rhythmancy-spells.md#no-stone-unturned)_ |
| 9  | _[The Wind in My Sails](ch-5-rhythmancy-spells.md#the-wind-in-my-sails)_ |
| 13 | _[The Sage of Earth's Calling](ch-5-rhythmancy-spells.md#the-sage-of-earths-calling)_ |
| 17 | _[Healing Balm](ch-5-rhythmancy-spells.md#healing-balm)_ |

### Level 3: Music-Maker

You are in sync with the music of the wilds, allowing you to direct nature's song into musical instruments. You gain the following benefits.

_**Instrument Training.**_ You gain Proficiency with a Musical Instrument of your choice, and with a tool of your choice capable of crafting that instrument. Leatherworker's Tools, Potter's Tools, or Woodworker's Tools might be suitable choices.

_**Spellcasting Focus.**_ You can use a Musical Instrument as a Spellcasting Focus for your Ranger spells.

_**Craft Instrument.**_ As part of a Short Rest, you can use tools and expend a level 1+ spell slot to craft a special magic item known as an **[Instrument of the Wild](ch-6-rhythmancy-magic-items.md#instrument-of-the-wild)** and imbue it with a Ranger or Rhythmancy spell you have prepared, which is added to the instrument's list of imbued spells. You can make any type of instrument you like using this feature, as long as your tools are capable of crafting the instrument and you have Proficiency in the tools. The design of the instrument is up to you; for example, you might carve a bone from an animal you hunted to make an ocarina. When you finish crafting the instrument, you can optionally immediately Attune to it, which doesn't count against the number of magic items you can be Attuned to at once. You can also gift your instrument to other creatures.

An **Instrument of the Wild** you create contains a number of charges equal to the level of the spell you imbued during its creation, which also determines its rarity and list of imbued spells. As a Magic action, you can replace a spell imbued in an **Instrument of the Wild** with a Level 1+ Ranger or Rhythmancy spell you have prepared by expending the appropriate spell slot and channeling the spell's magic into the instrument; the number of charges then adjusts as needed to match the amount required to cast the highest-level spell the instrument possesses.

You regain the ability to craft an **Instrument of the Wild** using this feature after you finish a Long Rest. You can maintain the magical properties in a number of **Instruments of the Wild** equal to the highest level Ranger spell you know. If you craft an **Instrument of the Wild** beyond your limit, one such instrument of your choice loses all of its magical properties, becoming a mundane version of that instrument.

### Level 7: Rhythm of the World

Your connection to the world's secret song strengthens. While you are Attuned to an **Instrument of the Wild**, your Rhythmancy spells gain a +1 to their attack rolls and total damage rolls, and when you cast a level 1+ Rhythmancy spell, you can expend one of the instrument's charges to cast the spell at one level higher than the original spell level; for example, casting a level 1 Rhythmancy spell and expending a charge would cast that spell at level 2.

Additionally, you gain the ability to tap into the music of an unfamiliar environment and learn its underlying structure. When you cast _The Lost is Found_, for the spell's duration or until you leave the same environment you were in when casting the spell, the environment is considered to be your favored terrain, granting you Expertise in Intelligence and Wisdom checks you make related to the terrain.

### Level 11: Song of Leaf and Claw

Your ear for the songs of the natural world allows you to channel your magic through that musical structure. If you prepare any of the following Ranger spells, they are also considered to be Rhythmancy spells: _Animal Friendship_, _Beast Bond_, _Locate Animals or Plants_, _Speak with Animals_, and _Speak with Plants_. If you cast one of these spells using Rhythmancy Points or **Instrument of the Wild** charges, the Rhythmancy Point and instrument charge cost is reduced by 1.

In addition, when you cast a Rhythmancy spell with a casting time of 1 action, you can make a weapon attack as a Bonus Action.

### Level 15: World Strider

You recall every tree you have encountered, and can travel through the world's root systems to be reunited with them at a moment's notice. You always have the _Tree Stride_ spell prepared, and you can cast it by expending a level 4+ spell slot. Starting at level 17, you always have the _Transport via Plants_ spell prepared, and you can cast it by expending a level 5+ spell slot.
