# Chapter 3: Rhythmancy Classes

This section includes new subclass options with abilities centered around the use of rhythmancy magic.

## Bard

At level 3, a Bard gains the choice of a subclass. The following option is made available to you when making that choice: the College of Legends.

### College of Legends

Though all bards have the ability to learn rhythmancy spells, practitioners of the College of Legends have built entire careers out of unlocking the magic sealed within these songs. These maestros are often sought out as teachers to aid new students in their rhythmantic studies, passing on what they learned from their own masters of the craft.

#### Level 3: Legendary Recall

You have extensively pored through history books and sought out hidden knowledge of ancient heroes. You gain Proficiency in two skills of your choice from the following list: Arcana, History, Nature, or Religion. Additionally, when you make an Intelligence check, you can expend one use of Bardic Inspiration; roll the Bardic Inspiration die, and add the number rolled to the d20.

#### Level 3: Rhythmantic Savant

You have an innate understanding of the magic of music and how to wield it. You gain the following benefits.

_**Harmonic Magic.**_ Any Bard spell you have prepared is also considered to be a Rhythmancy spell.

_**Speed Training.**_ Whenever you learn a new song through rhythmantic training, you bypass all training requirements, including finding a teacher, all training costs and issues, and any time requirements. Instead, you learn the Rhythmancy spell as a Magic action and by expending either a spell slot of a level equal to the spell's level, or that number of Rhythmancy Points (for cantrips, expend a level 1 spell slot or 1 Rhythmancy Point). You cannot learn a Rhythmancy spell in this manner if you do not have an appropriate spell slot or sufficient Rhythmancy Points available to spend.

_**Abjurative Melody.**_ When you cast a level 1+ Rhythmancy spell targeting one or more creatures, in addition to the spell's normal effects, you can choose to grant any such targets a number of Temporary Hit Points equal to the spell level.

#### Level 6: Inner Song

You can channel your song to temporarily boost the power of your rhythmantic magic. At the end of a Long Rest, you can expend one use of Bardic Inspiration to roll a Bardic Inspiration die and gain a number of temporary Rhythmancy Points equal to the number rolled. While you have these temporary Rhythmancy Points, they can be spent to cast or learn spells as if they were normal Rhythmancy Points, but they don't count toward your total number of Rhythmancy Points to determine the level of Rhythmancy spell you can cast or learn. Unspent temporary Rhythmancy Points from this feature disappear after you finish your next Long Rest.

#### Level 14: Legendary Secrets

You have mastered unlocking hidden or lost ancient secrets. You always have the _Legend Lore_ spell prepared. You can cast it once without expending a spell slot, and you regain the ability to do so when you finish a Long Rest. When you cast _Legend Lore_ using this feature, you can cast it as an action rather than its normal casting time, and you replace its Material component requirements with an instrument worth 1+ GP. You can also cast _Legend Lore_ normally using a spell slot of the appropriate level.

## Fighter

At level 3, a Fighter gains the choice of a subclass. The following option is made available to you when making that choice: the Reveler.

### Reveler

Though skilled in the art of martial combat, Revelers also engage in studies of musical composition and kinetic performance, aided by channeling rhythmantic magic. Rather than dividing their focus, these shared disciplines complement each other, leading to Fighters gifted with fluent movement on the battlefield and equal command of the dance floor.

#### Level 3: Bravado

Thanks to your practice at performing in front of audiences, you gain the following benefits.

- You gain Proficiency in the Performance skill.
- You can channel the raw charisma of your performance when you attempt certain tasks; when you make an ability check using one of the following skills, you can make it as a Charisma check even if it normally uses a different ability: Animal Handling, Deception, Intimidation, Persuasion, Sleight of Hand, or Stealth. When you use this ability, your Charisma represents your command over others, honing your ability to be seen or unseen to achieve your goals.

  You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.

#### Level 3: Rhythmancy Warrior

You have engaged in the study of magic song and incorporated it into your combat training. You gain the following benefits.

_**Cantrips.**_ You learn two cantrips: _True Strike_ and one other Rhythmancy cantrip of your choice.

Whenever you gain a Fighter level, you can replace one of your cantrips with another Rhythmancy cantrip of your choice.

When you reach Fighter level 10, you learn another Rhythmancy cantrip of your choice.

_**Rhythmancy Points.**_ You gain 2 Rhythmancy Points to spend on casting Rhythmancy spells.

_**Prepared Spells.**_ Choose two level 1 Rhythmancy spells. You always have these spells prepared, and you can cast them using Rhythmancy Points or any spell slots you have.

_**Changing Your Prepared Spells.**_ Whenever you gain a Fighter level, you can replace one spell on your list with another Rhythmancy spell of an eligible level.

_**Instrument Training.**_ You gain a Musical Instrument of your choice, and you have Proficiency with it. Additionally, whenever you finish a Long Rest, you can replace this Proficiency with another Musical Instrument of your choice that you possess.

#### Level 7: Blade Staccato

You fight to the rhythm of your song, attempting to overwhelm your foes with multiple attacks. When you cast _True Strike_, its duration changes to 1 minute, and its benefits are applied to all weapon attacks you make for the duration. The spell ends early if you miss an attack.

#### Level 10: Diagetic Surge

You draw energy from the music that churns through your veins. When you expend a use of either your Action Surge or Second Wind, in addition to the feature's normal effects, you regain all expended Rhythmancy Points from your Rhythmancy Warrior feature.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a Long Rest.

#### Level 15: Shared Song

. When you cast a Rhythmancy spell targeting yourself, you can also affect one willing ally with the spell if the ally is within 10 feet of you. Additionally, you can participate in a Rhythmancy Duet even if you do not have the spell prepared, as long as the other participant has the spell prepared.

#### Level 18: Pitch Perfect

Through intensive rehearsal, you have perfected your favorite compositions and can readily perform them with no preparation. Choose one of the level 1 Rhythmancy spells you have prepared that has a casting time of an action. You can cast this spell at its lowest level without expending Rhythmancy Points. To cast this spell at a higher level, you must expend Rhythmancy Points.

Additionally, when you take the Attack action on your turn, you can replace one of the attacks with a casting of the spell you chose for this feature.

Whenever you finish a Long Rest, you can replace the spell you chose for this feature with a different level 1 Rhythmancy spell you have prepared with a casting time of an action.

## Ranger

At level 3, a Ranger gains the choice of a subclass. The following option is made available to you when making that choice: the Wild Composer.

### Wild Composer

> You know there's rhythm all around us: the waves break in rhythm, people walk in rhythm, people breathe in rhythm, too. People work in rhythm! The whole world is made up of rhythm.
>
> — Victor Brady, _[Let's Go Play to the Rhythm of the World](https://youtu.be/g1zNAbrU1zM)_

Rangers who walk the path of the Wild Composer are drawn to the innate music present in the natural world. They revel in the melody of leaves rustling in the wind like chimes, and play along as woodpeckers drum a steady beat on tall steadfast trees. To these adventurers, the wild itself has a breath and cadence that grants those who can hear it great wisdom.

#### Level 3: Wild Composer Spells

When you reach a Ranger level specified in the Wild Composer Spells table, you thereafter always have the listed spells prepared.

##### Wild Composer Spells

| Ranger Level | Spells |
|:------------:|:-------|
| 3  | _The Hawk's Call_, _The Lost is Found_ |
| 5  | _Song of Discovery_ |
| 9  | _Wind's Requiem_ |
| 13 | _Earth God's Lyric_ |
| 17 | _Song of Healing_ |

#### Level 3: Music-Maker

You are in sync with the music of the wilds, allowing you to direct nature's song into musical instruments. You gain the following benefits.

_**Instrument Training.**_ You gain Proficiency with a Musical Instrument of your choice, and with a tool of your choice capable of crafting that instrument (Leatherworker's Tools, Potter's Tools, or Woodworker's Tools might be suitable choices).

_**Spellcasting Focus.**_ You can use a Musical Instrument as a Spellcasting Focus for your Ranger spells.

_**Craft Instrument.**_ As part of a Short Rest, you can use tools and expend a level 1+ spell slot to craft a special magic item known as an **[Instrument of the Wild](ch-6-rhythmancy-magic-items.md#instrument-of-the-wild)** and imbue it with a Ranger or Rhythmancy spell you have prepared, which is added to the instrument's list of imbued spells. You can make any type of instrument you like using this feature, as long as your tools are capable of crafting the instrument and you have Proficiency in the tools. The design of the instrument is up to you; for example, you might carve a bone from an animal you hunted to make an ocarina. When you finish crafting the instrument, you can optionally immediately Attune to it, which doesn't count against the number of magic items you can be Attuned to at once. You can also gift your instrument to other creatures.

An **Instrument of the Wild** you create contains a number of charges equal to the level of the spell you imbued during its creation, which also determines its rarity and list of imbued spells. As a Magic action, you can replace a spell imbued in an **Instrument of the Wild** with a Level 1+ Ranger or Rhythmancy spell you have prepared by expending the appropriate spell slot and channeling the spell's magic into the instrument; the number of charges then adjusts as needed to match the amount required to cast the highest-level spell the instrument possesses.

You regain the ability to craft an **Instrument of the Wild** using this feature after you finish a Long Rest. You can maintain the magical properties in a number of **Instruments of the Wild** equal to the highest level Ranger spell you know. If you craft an **Instrument of the Wild** beyond your limit, one such instrument of your choice loses all of its magical properties, becoming a mundane version of that instrument.

#### Level 7: Rhythm of the World

Your connection to the world's secret song strengthens. While you are Attuned to an **Instrument of the Wild**, your Rhythmancy spells gain a +1 to their attack rolls and total damage rolls, and when you cast a level 1+ Rhythmancy spell, you can expend one of the instrument's charges to cast the spell at one level higher than the original spell level; for example, casting a level 1 Rhythmancy spell and expending a charge would cast that spell at level 2.

Additionally, you gain the ability to tap into the music of an unfamiliar environment and learn its underlying structure. When you cast _The Lost is Found_, for the spell's duration or until you leave the same environment you were in when casting the spell, the environment is considered to be your favored terrain, granting you Expertise in Intelligence and Wisdom checks you make related to the terrain.

#### Level 11: Song of Leaf and Claw

Your ear for the songs of the natural world allows you to channel your magic through that musical structure. If you prepare any of the following Ranger spells, they are also considered to be Rhythmancy spells: _Animal Friendship_, _Beast Bond_, _Locate Animals or Plants_, _Speak with Animals_, and _Speak with Plants_. If you cast one of these spells using Rhythmancy Points or **Instrument of the Wild** charges, the Rhythmancy Point and instrument charge cost is reduced by 1.

In addition, when you cast a Rhythmancy spell with a casting time of 1 action, you can make a weapon attack as a Bonus Action.

#### Level 15: World Strider

You recall every tree you have encountered, and can travel through the world's root systems to be reunited with them at a moment's notice. You always have the _Tree Stride_ spell prepared, and you can cast it by expending a level 4+ spell slot. Starting at level 17, you always have the _Transport via Plants_ spell prepared, and you can cast it by expending a level 5+ spell slot.
