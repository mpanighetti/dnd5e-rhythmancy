# Chapter 3: Rhythmancy Classes

This section includes two new subclass options with abilities centered around the use of rhythmancy magic: the College of Legends for the Bard and the Wild Composer for the Ranger.

## Bard

At 3rd level, a Bard gains the choice of a subclass. The following option is made available to you when making that choice: the College of Legends.

### College of Legends

Though all bards have the ability to learn rhythmancy spells, practitioners of the College of Legends have built entire careers out of unlocking the magic sealed within these songs. These maestros are often sought out as teachers to aid new students in their rhythmantic studies, passing on what they learned from their own masters of the craft.

#### Legendary Recall

You have extensively pored through history books and sought out hidden knowledge of ancient heroes. You gain Proficiency in two skills of your choice from the following list: Arcana, History, Nature, or Religion. Additionally, when you make an Intelligence check, you can expend one use of Bardic Inspiration; roll the Bardic Inspiration die, and add the number rolled to the d20.

#### Rhythmantic Savant

You have an innate understanding of the magic of music and how to wield it, granting you the following benefits.

- You have a number of Rhythmancy Points equal to your Bard level divided by 3 (round down).
- Any Bard spell you know is also considered to be a Rhythmancy spell.
- Whenever you learn a new song through rhythmantic training, you bypass all training requirements, including finding a teacher, all training costs and issues, and any time requirements. Instead, you learn the Rhythmancy spell as a Magic action and by spending a number of Rhythmancy Points equal to the spell's level (minimum 1 Rhythmancy Point). You cannot learn a Rhythmancy spell in this manner if you do not have a sufficient number of Rhythmancy Points available to spend.
- When you cast a level 1+ Rhythmancy spell targeting one or more creatures, in addition to the spell's normal effects, you can choose to grant any such targets a number of Temporary Hit Points equal to the spell level.

#### Level 6: Inner Song

You can channel your song to temporarily boost the power of your rhythmantic magic. At the end of a Long Rest, you can expend one use of Bardic Inspiration to roll a Bardic Inspiration die and gain a number of temporary Rhythmancy Points equal to the number rolled. While you have these temporary Rhythmancy Points, they can be used to cast and learn spells as if they were normal Rhythmancy Points. Any spent temporary points cease to count toward your maximum number of Rhythmancy Points when determining whether you can learn a new song, and any such points you don't spend disappear after you finish your next Long Rest.

#### Level 14: Legendary Secrets

You have mastered unlocking hidden or lost ancient secrets. You always have the _Legend Lore_ spell prepared. When you cast _Legend Lore_ using Rhythmancy Points, the casting time is 1 action, and you replace its Material component requirements with an instrument worth at least 1 GP.

## Fighter

At 3rd level, a Fighter gains the choice of a subclass. The following option is made available to you when making that choice: the ?.

### ?

#### Rhythmancy Warrior

You've begun studying the magic of rhythmantic songs. You gain the following benefits.

_**Rhythmancy Points.**_ You have a number of Rhythmancy Points equal to your Fighter level divided by 5 (round up) to spend on casting Rhythmancy spells. Any Bard spell you know is also considered to be a Rhythmancy spell, and you can cast these spells using Rhythmancy Points.

_**Cantrips.**_ You know two cantrips of your choice from the Bard spell list. _[The Royal Decree](ch-5-rhythmancy-spells.md#the-royal-decree)_ and _True Strike_ are recommended. Whenever you gain a Fighter level, you can replace one of these cantrips with another cantrip of your choice from the Bard spell list.

When you reach Fighter level 10, you learn another Bard cantrip of your choice.

_**Prepared Spells of Level 1+.**_ You prepare the list of level 1+ spells that are available for you to cast with this feature. To start, choose a level 1 spell from the Bard spell list. _[Equine Tribute](ch-5-rhythmancy-spells.md#equine-tribute)_ or _Heroism_ are recommended.

You can prepare a number spells equal to your total number of Rhythmancy Points. Whenever that number increases, choose additional spells from the Bard spell list until the number of spells on your list matches the number on the table. The chosen spells must be of a level for which you have sufficient Rhythmancy Points to cast. For example, if you're a level 11 Fighter, your list of prepared spells can include three Bard spells of levels 1, 2, and 3 in any combination.

_**Changing Your Prepared Spells.**_ Whenever you gain a Fighter level, you can replace one spell on your list with another Bard spell for which you have sufficient Rhythmancy Points.

_**Instrument Training.**_ You gain Proficiency with a Musical Instrument of your choice.



## Ranger

At 3rd level, a Ranger gains the choice of a subclass. The following option is made available to you when making that choice: the Wild Composer.

### Wild Composer

> You know there's rhythm all around us: the waves break in rhythm, people walk in rhythm, people breathe in rhythm, too. People work in rhythm! The whole world is made up of rhythm.
>
> — Victor Brady, _[Let's Go Play to the Rhythm of the World](https://youtu.be/g1zNAbrU1zM)_

Rangers who walk the path of the Wild Composer are drawn to the innate music present in the natural world. They revel in the melody of leaves rustling in the wind like chimes, and play along as woodpeckers drum a steady beat on tall steadfast trees. To these adventurers, the wild itself has a breath and cadence that grants those who can hear it great wisdom.

#### Wild Composer Spells

When you reach a Ranger level specified in the Wild Composer Spells table, you thereafter always have the listed spells prepared.

##### Wild Composer Spells

| Ranger Level | Spells |
|:------------:|:-------|
| 3rd  | _The Hawk's Call_, _The Lost is Found_ |
| 5th  | _Song of Discovery_ |
| 9th  | _Wind's Requiem_ |
| 13th | _Earth God's Lyric_ |
| 17th | _Song of Healing_ |

#### Music-Maker

You are in sync with the music of the wilds, allowing you to direct nature's song into musical instruments. You gain Proficiency with an instrument and a tool of your choice capable of crafting that instrument (Leatherworker's Tools, Potter's Tools, or Woodworker's Tools might be suitable choices), amd you can use a Musical Instrument as a Spellcasting Focus for your Ranger spells.

Additionally, as part of a Short Rest, you can use tools and expend a level 1+ spell slot to craft a special magic item known as an **[Instrument of the Wild](ch-6-rhythmancy-magic-items.md#instrument-of-the-wild)** and imbue it with a Ranger or Rhythmancy spell you have prepared, which is added to the instrument's list of imbued spells. You can make any type of instrument you like using this feature, as long as your tools are capable of crafting the instrument and you have Proficiency in the tools. The design of the instrument is up to you; for example, you might carve a bone from an animal you hunted to make an ocarina. When you finish crafting the instrument, you can optionally immediately Attune to it, which doesn't count against the number of magic items you can be Attuned to at once. You can also gift your instrument to other creatures.

An **Instrument of the Wild** you create contains a number of charges equal to the level of the spell you imbued during its creation, which also determines its rarity and list of imbued spells. As a Magic action, you can replace a spell imbued in an **Instrument of the Wild** with a Level 1+ Ranger or Rhythmancy spell you have prepared by expending the appropriate spell slot and channeling the spell's magic into the instrument; the number of charges then adjusts as needed to match the amount required to cast the highest-level spell the instrument possesses.

You regain the ability to craft an **Instrument of the Wild** using this feature after you finish a Long Rest. You can maintain the magical properties in a number of **Instruments of the Wild** equal to the highest level Ranger spell you know. If you craft an **Instrument of the Wild** beyond your limit, one such instrument of your choice loses all of its magical properties, becoming a mundane version of that instrument.

#### Level 7: Rhythm of the World

Your connection to the world's secret song strengthens. While you are Attuned to an **Instrument of the Wild**, your Rhythmancy spells gain a +1 to their attack rolls and total damage rolls, and when you cast a level 1+ Rhythmancy spell, you can expend one of the instrument's charges to cast the spell at one level higher than the original spell level; for example, casting a level 1 Rhythmancy spell and expending a charge would cast that spell at level 2.

Additionally, you gain the ability to tap into the music of an unfamiliar environment and learn its underlying structure. When you cast _The Lost is Found_, the casting time is 1 action, and for the spell's duration or until you leave the same environment you were in when casting the spell, the environment is considered to be your favored terrain, granting you Expertise in Intelligence and Wisdom checks you make related to the terrain.

#### Level 11: Song of Leaf and Claw

Your ear for the songs of the natural world allows you to channel your magic through that musical structure. If you prepare any of the following Ranger spells, they are also considered to be Rhythmancy spells: _Animal Friendship_, _Beast Bond_, _Locate Animals or Plants_, _Speak with Animals_, and _Speak with Plants_. If you cast one of these spells using Rhythmancy Points or **Instrument of the Wild** charges, the Rhythmancy Point and instrument charge cost is reduced by 1.

In addition, when you cast a Rhythmancy spell with a casting time of 1 action, you can make a melee or ranged weapon attack as a Bonus Action.

#### Level 15: World Strider

You recall every tree you have encountered, and can travel through the world's root systems to be reunited with them at a moment's notice. You always have the _Tree Stride_ spell prepared, and you can cast it by expending a level 4+ spell slot. Starting at level 17, you always have the _Transport via Plants_ spell prepared, and you can cast it by expending a level 5+ spell slot.
