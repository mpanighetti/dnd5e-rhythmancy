The magic items are presented in alphabetical order.

### [Instrument of the Wild](https://github.com/mpanighetti/dnd5e-magic-items/blob/main/wondrous-items/instrument-of-the-wild.md)

_Wondrous item (any instrument), rarity varies (requires Attunement by someone able to cast rhythmancy spells)_

This instrument was lovingly crafted by an artist with a profound connection to the rhythm of the natural world, and they have imbued some of their own magic into the craft and design. The instrument manifests the magical gift of its creation as one or more rhythmancy spells and charges that can be spent on the instrument's properties; the number of charges is equal to the spell slot level that was used to create the instrument, which also determines its rarity. The instrument regains 1d4 expended charges at dawn.

You can cast rhythmancy spells imbued in an _instrument of the wild_ by expending a number of charges equal to the spell's level. The rarity determines the spells the instrument possesses, and an _instrument of the wild_ of a higher rarity also includes the spells from all rarities below it (for example, an uncommon _instrument of the wild_ includes both _The Lost is Found_ and _Song of Discovery_). At the Dungeon Master's discretion, some of these instruments can be found with additional stored spells from the ranger spell list; such spells are a reflection of the person who crafted the instrument and the magical properties they imparted to it, and they are considered rhythmancy spells for the purpose of casting by expending charges.
