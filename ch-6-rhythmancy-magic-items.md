## Magic Item Descriptions

The magic items are presented in alphabetical order.

### [Instrument of the Wild](https://github.com/mpanighetti/dnd5e-magic-items/blob/main/wondrous-items/instrument-of-the-wild.md)

_Wondrous item (any instrument), rarity varies (requires Attunement by someone able to cast rhythmancy spells)_

This instrument was lovingly crafted by an artist with a profound connection to the rhythm of the natural world, and they have imbued some of their own magic into the craft and design. The instrument manifests the magical gift of its creation as one or more rhythmancy spells. It also contains charges that can be spent to cast these spells at a cost of one charge per spell level. The number of charges vary based on its rarity. The instrument regains 1d4 expended charges at dawn.

An _instrument of the wild_ contains one or more spells based on its number of charges and rarity, and an instrument of a higher rarity also includes the spells from all rarities below it (for example, an uncommon _instrument of the wild_ includes both _The Lost is Found_ and _Song of Discovery_). At the Dungeon Master's discretion, some of these instruments can be found with replacement imbued spells from the ranger spell list; such spells are a reflection of the person who crafted the instrument and the magical properties they imparted to it, and they are considered rhythmancy spells for the purpose of casting by expending charges.

##### Instrument of the Wild Rarity
| Charges | Rhythmancy Spell | Rarity |
|:-:|:-|:-|
| 1 | _The Lost is Found_ | Common |
| 2 | _Song of Discovery_ | Uncommon |
| 3 | _Wind's Requiem_ | Rare |
| 4 | _Earth God's Lyric_ | Very rare |
| 5 | _Song of Healing_ | Legendary |

### [Maracas of Holding](https://github.com/mpanighetti/dnd5e-magic-items/blob/main/wondrous-items/maracas-of-holding.md)

_Wondrous item (instrument, maracas), rare (requires Attunement)_

These maracas are filled with dried seeds that clatter when the instruments are shaken, and they seem to have an endless capacity for more seeds.

The _maracas of holding_ contain 3 charges. While you are Attuned to the _maracas of holding_, you can perform a dance with the maracas for 1 minute to magically imbue a nonmagical bag, backpack, or similar storage item you touch with increased storage capacity, temporarily turning the item into a magic item with the storage properties of a _bag of holding_. Performing this dance expends 1 charge from the maracas. If the maracas have no charges remaining when you perform this dance, one of the items of your choice that was transformed in this manner is restored to its original nonmagical form, at which point anything still inside its interior in excess of its normal capacity is expelled. Ending Attunement to the _maracas of holding_ causes all such items you transformed to be restored to their nonmagical forms.
