# Rhythmancy: The Magic of Music

Rhythmancy is a fundamental magical force that is summoned through the performance of music. Though it is sometimes considered an independent school of magical study, rhythmancy spells all align with various existing schools and can potentially be learned by any arcane practitioners â€” if they know where to look.

## Learning Rhythmancy Spells

Rhythmancy songs are primarily passed down from teacher to student, or are sometimes buried with their creators and forgotten for centuries before being rediscovered by later explorers. The discovery of a composition infused with rhythmantic magic is often a world-changing event, unlocking access to long-forgotten secrets. On some worlds, rhythmancy is a completely unknown school of study.

### Who Can Learn Rythmancy

What separates rhythmancy spells from others is an intrinsic attachment to musical composition and performance as a channeling force.

Bards are naturally suited for learning rhythmancy magic and can learn any such spells through their normal spellcasting options, as they carry on a long tradition of passing secret songs of power down through the ages from their tutors to their future apprentices. Additionally, feats are available in this document that provide direct access to some low-level rhythmancy spells.

Any other magically inclined student can potentially learn rhythmantic magic they come upon if they meet the following requirements:

- They must already be able to cast a spell of the same level or higher using a feature or trait.
- They must have proficiency in a musical instrument.
- They must either be taught by someone else who knows rhythmantic songs, or they must find a written copy of the spell and teach themself.

#### Optional: Rhythmancy Spells for Other Classes

By default, rhythmantic magic is only available on the bard spell list, through rhythmancy feats, or through training or self-teaching when a rhythmancy spell is discovered. However, the Game Master can optionally make any or all rhythmancy spells available for spellcasters if they wish. If the GM allows, anyone with the Spellcasting or Pact Magic feature, or a feat that allowing learning a spell, could potentially learn rhythmancy as a spell option using these features, as long as they also have proficiency in a musical instrument. With this option, the rhythmancy spell is learned in place of the existing spell when the feature is gained.

### Rhythmantic Training

If a student is able to find a willing teacher who knows rhythmancy spells, and they meet all the requirements for learning the rhythmantic song, they can be taught the spell with time and practice.

Learning a rhythmancy spell from a teacher involves 2 workweeks of training per spell level or for a cantrip, and costs 25 gp per workweek. The time and gold represents the cost of materials involved in writing liner notes, copying the spell to the student's songbook, and maintaining and repairing their instrument as they learn to channel the raw musical power.

At the end of the training period, the song is added to the student's known spells as a rhythmancy spell.

#### Self-Teaching

If a rhythmancy spell is written out on a spell scroll or as sheet music, anyone who meets all the requirements to learn the rhythmantic song can do so by practicing the composition and teaching themself. This bypasses the requirement for an instructor, but as a tradeoff for not having the guidance of a teacher, the number of workweeks required is doubled. Once per workweek, the student can attempt to remove that week's training costs by succeeding on a DC 15 Charisma (Performance) check. This check represents practicing the rhythmantic composition in front of crowds in local taverns as you perfect your understanding of the performative magic. On a failed check, in addition to the normal costs of learning your rhythmantic spell, roll on the **Rhythmantic Training Issues** table.

##### Rhythmantic Training Issues
| d6 | Issue |
|:--:|:------|
| 1  | The rhythmantic song's magic accidentally activates, targeting a random patron with the spell's effects. |
| 2  | A drunken brawl breaks out during your performance and you're blamed for inciting a public disturbance. The venue demands 50 gp payment for damages before allowing you to continue practicing there. |
| 3  | The rhythmantic song's magic manifests as a destructive thunderous burst of energy. You cast _thunderwave_ toward the audience. |
| 4  | Your underwhelming performance has resulted in reduced attendance, giving you disadvantage on Charisma (Performance) checks used in the next 1d4 attempts to remove training costs. |
| 5  | A regular attendee of your shows appears to be taking detailed notes of your rhythmantic composition in an attempt to copy it. |
| 6  | A drink stain on your songbook has smeared your notes, making them illegible. Add 1 workweek to the total required for learning the rhythmancy song as you recreate your notes. |

### Adding Rhythmancy Spells

Depending on how they use magic normally, a student can add rhythmantic songs they have successfully learned to their known spells using one of three options: as a class spell using the Spellcasting or Pact Magic feature (**option 1**); through another feature that allows casting spells (**option 2**); or through a trait that grants the ability to cast a spell (**option 3**).

1. **If you have the Spellcasting or Pact Magic feature and have spell slots of the same level or higher:** The rhythmancy spell is added to your list of known class spells. If you have Spellcasting or Pact Magic from multiple classes, pick one class under which you learn all rhythmantic magic. You can change this selection any time you gain a level, as long as the class you choose is also able to cast spells at a level equal to or higher than the highest-level rhythmancy spell you know.

2. **If you have another class feature or feat that grants the ability to cast a spell of the same level or higher:** The rhythmancy spell is made available as an alternative spell using this feature.

3. **If you have a species trait that grants the ability to cast a spell of the same level or higher:** The rhythmancy spell is made available as an alternative spell using this trait.

You must use the first option available to you based on your class levels, features, traits, and the rhythmancy spell's level and casting requirements. If the spell is added under option 2 or 3 and a higher option is made available later (such as gaining the Spellcasting feature), all your compatible rhythmancy spells immediately move to the highest-available option. If none of these options are available, you cannot learn the spell. If you lose access to all your options later (such as the _reincarnate_ spell changing you into a creature lacking the ability to cast spells), you retain the knowledge of your rhythmancy spells but are unable to cast them unless you regain compatible spellcasting options later.

## Casting Rhythmancy Spells

Rhythmancy spells mostly follow existing rules for spellcasting, with several notable exceptions.

### Cantrips

Rhythmantic cantrips can be cast an unlimited number of times, regardless of feature or trait restrictions on casting spells.

### Component Requirements

All rhythmancy spells, in addition to normal spell slot usage and component requirements, include both a verbal component and a specific material component requirement of a musical instrument with a value of at least 1 gp. This instrument substitutes as your spellcasting focus when using rhythmantic magic.

Due to the inherently performative nature of rhythmancy, the requirements for both a verbal component and musical instrument cannot be bypassed with any class feature (such as a sorcerer's Subtle Spell metamagic option), trait, or any other ability, unless it specifically allows ignoring component requirements for rhythmancy magic.

### Spellcasting and Pact Magic

When you cast a rhythmancy spell learned through the Spellcasting or Pact Magic feature, it is considered to be a spell of that feature's class for the purpose of casting it, and it expends spell slots of the appropriate level normally.

### Rhythmancy Points

If you have rhythmancy points, you can cast a rhythmancy spell you know by spending a number of rhythmancy points equal to the spell's level. Additional rhythmancy points can be spent to cast the spell at a higher level at a cost of 1 rhythmancy point per level increase. Charisma is your spellcasting ability for spells cast using rhythmancy points. You regain all spent rhythmancy points when you finish a Long Rest.

If you discover a new rhythmancy spell in your travels, you are eligible to learn the song if your total possible rhythmancy points are equal to or greater than the spell's level. For example, if you are a College of Legends bard with a Charisma of 17 and you take the Rhythmancy Initiate feat, you have a total of 4 rhythmancy points and thus are eligible to learn rhythmancy spells up to 4th-level.

### Other Features and Traits

When a rhythmancy spell of 1st-level or higher is being cast in place of another spell granted by a feature or trait, you choose the spell you are replacing with a rhythmancy spell each time you cast it.

If the casting of a spell using such features is subject to special rules and limitations, apply these rules using the guidelines below:

#### Discipline Points

If a monk feature requires spending discipline points (sometimes called "ki points") to cast a spell of 1st-level or higher, the cost of casting a rhythmancy spell is a number of discipline points equal to 1 + the spell's level. For example, casting _Song of Storms_ using the Empty Body feature would require spending 3 discipline points.

Additional discipline points can be spent to cast the spell at a higher level at 1 discipline point per level increase, as long as you already have the ability to cast a spell at that level using discipline points.

#### Limited Uses

If the feature or trait requires spending from a limited number of charges to cast spells, casting a rhythmancy spell costs the same as another spell of the same level or higher.

If the feature or trait allows casting spells of 1st-level or higher once before requiring a rest to recharge (such as the Infernal Legacy trait), the rhythmancy spell can be selected in place of the existing spell options, expending the spell use as if it were the existing spell.

If the feature or trait allows casting a spell of 1st-level or higher an unlimited number of times, you can choose to cast a rhythmancy spell of the same spell level or lower once with this trait. Once you cast it, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest, but you can continue to use the default spell from this trait as normal.

#### Spell Limitations

If a feature or trait imposes any other limitations on casting its existing spells, the rhythmancy spell must follow those same limitations. For example, the Empty Body feature doesn't allow taking creatures with you when casting _astral projection_, so a rhythmancy spell cast in this manner also cannot take creatures with you if it normally has this ability.

If the spell cannot be used with the feature's limitations, it cannot be learned in this manner. For example, the Ascendant Step eldritch invocation only allows casting _levitate_ on yourself, so if a rhythmancy spell is unable to target yourself, you cannot learn it using Ascendant Step.

### Duets

Some rhythmancy songs are written to be performed by two musicians working together to create more powerful magic than they could accomplish on their own. Duets function like normal spells but come with additional requirements for the magic to be successfully linked between the two casters:

- The rhythmancy spell performed by both casters must be the same.
- Both performers must choose the same target when casting their spells.
- Both casters must provide all required components and spell slots.
- After the first spellcasting is begun, the partner's spell must begin before the first caster's next turn. To ensure synchrony, one partner could use the Ready action so that their spell begins casting as a reaction to the other partner starting their song.
- Both casters must be able to hear each other during the entire casting times of the spells to ensure their performances remain in sync.

If any of the above conditions are not met, both castings of the duet spell fail. Otherwise, the spells grant their shared effect after both casters complete the required casting time.

If a duet is targeted by an effect or check that requires knowing the spellcasting ability, spell save DC, or spell attack modifier of the caster, use the higher of the two attributes from the duet's performers. If the effect or check requires knowing the spell slot level (such as _dispel magic_) and the performers used two different level spell slots, use the lower of the two spell slot levels.

## [Bard Subclass: College of Legends](https://github.com/mpanighetti/dnd5e-classes/blob/main/bard/college-of-legends.md)

At 3rd level, a bard gains the choice of a subclass. The following option is made available to you when making that choice: the College of Legends.

### College of Legends Features

Though all bards have the ability to learn rhythmancy spells, practitioners of the College of Legends have built entire careers out of unlocking the magic sealed within these songs. These bards are often sought out as teachers to aid new students in their rhythmantic studies, passing on what they learned from their own masters of the craft.

#### Legendary Recall

_3rd-level College of Legends feature_

You have extensively pored through history books and sought out hidden knowledge of ancient heroes. You gain proficiency in two skills of your choice from the following list: Arcana, History, Nature, or Religion. Additionally, when you make an Intelligence check, you can expend one use of Bardic Inspiration to add twice your proficiency bonus to the check, even if you do not normally have proficiency or expertise in the related skill.

#### Rhythmantic Savant

_3rd-level College of Legends feature_

You have an innate understanding of the magic of music and how to wield it, granting you the following benefits.

- You have a number of rhythmancy points equal to your bard level divided by 3 (round down).
- You can use rhythmancy points to cast spells you know from any source as if they were rhythmancy spells.
- Whenever you learn a new song through rhythmantic training, you bypass all training requirements, including finding a teacher, all training costs and issues, and any time requirements. Instead, you learn the rhythmancy spell as an action and by spending a number of rhythmancy points equal to the spell's level (minimum 1 rhythmancy point). You cannot learn a rhythmancy song in this manner if you do not have a sufficient number of rhythmancy points available to spend.
- When you cast a spell of 1st-level or higher targeting a creature using rhythmancy points, in addition to the spell's normal effects, you can choose to grant the target a number of Temporary Hit Points equal to the number of rhythmancy points spent.

#### Inner Song

_6th-level College of Legends feature_

You can channel your bard song to temporarily boost the power of your rhythmancy magic. At the end of a Long Rest, you can expend one of your uses of Bardic Inspiration to roll a Bardic Inspiration die and gain a number of temporary rhythmancy points equal to the number rolled. While you have these temporary rhythmancy points, they can be spent to cast rhythmancy spells as if they were normal rhythmancy points, but they do not count toward your maximum number of rhythmancy points when determining whether you can learn a new rhythmancy song. Any temporary rhythmancy points gained in this manner disappear after you finish your next Long Rest.

Starting at 11th level, you can choose to expend two uses of Bardic Inspiration and roll two Bardic Inspiration dice when gaining temporary rhythmancy points at the end of a Long Rest.

#### Legendary Secrets

_14th-level College of Legends feature_

You have mastered unlocking hidden or lost ancient secrets. You learn the _legend lore_ spell, or another bard spell of your choice from the divination school for which you are eligible if you already know _legend lore_. This spell doesn't count against the number of bard spells you know. When you cast _legend lore_ using rhythmancy points, the casting time is 1 action, and you replace its material component requirements with a musical instrument worth at least 1 gp.

## Rhythmancy Feats

This section presents a sampling of feats appropriate for a campaign featuring rhythmancy magic. If a feat has a prerequisite, you must meet that prerequisite to gain the feat. The **Rhythmancy Feats** table lists the feats in this section along with the level at which they're available.

### Rhythmancy Feats
| Level | Feat | Category | Prerequisite | Repeatable |
|:-:|:-|:-|:-|:-:|
| 1st | [Rhythmancy Initiate](#rhythmancy-initiate) | Background | | no |

#### [Rhythmancy Initiate](https://github.com/mpanighetti/dnd5e-feats/blob/main/feats/rhythmancy-initiate.md)

_1st-Level Background Feat_

- **Prerequisite:** None
- **Repeatable:** No

Youâ€™ve begun studying the magic of rhythmantic songs:

- You gain 1 rhythmancy point to spend on casting rhythmancy spells. This point is added to any rhythmancy points you have from another source.
- You learn a rhythmancy cantrip and a 1st-level rhythmancy spell of your choice. Charisma is your spellcasting ability for spells cast using this feat.
- You gain proficiency in Performance checks and with a musical instrument of your choice. You can use such an instrument as a spellcasting focus for any rhythmancy spell you cast.

## Rhythmancy Spells

This section presents a sampling of spells developed through the musical study of rhythmancy. All rhythmancy spells are available to the bard class, as well as other spellcasting classes with the Game Masterâ€™s consent (see "Rhythmancy Spells for Other Classes"). The Rhythmancy Spells table lists the new spells, ordering them by level. The table also notes the schools of magic of a spell, whether it requires concentration, whether it bears the ritual tag, and whether it bears the duet tag.

In some cases, multiple rhythmancy spells are learned as a single song, existing as alternate versions of a composition and applying their unique effects only when cast at a higher level. Such spells are labeled with shared footnote markers on this list for reference; see the description for the lowest-level version of the spell for all the other spells' effects.

### Spell Descriptions

The spells are presented in alphabetical order.

#### [Ballad of Gales](https://github.com/mpanighetti/dnd5e-spells/blob/main/8th-level/ballad-of-gales.md)

_8th-level conjuration/rhythmancy_

- **Casting Time:** 1 minute
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, S, M (a musical instrument worth at least 1 gp, a vehicle that you are currently occupying worth at least 10 gp)
- **Duration:** 1 round

If you occupy a vehicle the entire time you cast this spell, you summon a shimmering portal surrounding the vehicle, and a second portal of the same size at another location on the same plane of existence. If the vehicle is a ship in water, the portals manifest as powerful cyclones in the waters at both locations. The portals remain open until the end of your next turn. Any creature or object that enters one portal, including you and all other creatures and objects aboard the target vehicle, instantly appears within 5 feet of the other portal, or in the nearest unoccupied space if that space is occupied. After the spell ends, the portals fade away.

You must have seen or been physically present at the destination at least once before, and the destination must have sufficient space to accommodate the vehicle, or the spell fails. The spell also fails when targeting a ship in water if the destination is not also in water.

The act of teleporting the vehicle deals it 8d6 force damage, ignoring damage thresholds.

#### [Ballad of the Dreamer](https://github.com/mpanighetti/dnd5e-spells/blob/main/cantrips/ballad-of-the-dreamer.md)

_Abjuration/rhythmancy cantrip_

- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V, M (a seagull's feather; a musical instrument worth at least 1 gp)
- **Duration:** 10 minutes

You play a soothing melody that conjures strange memories of a dream-like world. Until the spell ends, magic can't put you to sleep.

#### [Command Melody](https://github.com/mpanighetti/dnd5e-spells/blob/main/2nd-level/command-melody.md)

_2nd-level conjuration/rhythmancy (ritual)_

- **Casting Time:** 1 minute
- **Range:** 10 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a musical instrument worth at least 1 gp; objects belonging to you and the target creature worth a total of at least 1 sp which the spell consumes)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour

You conduct a brief tune for a willing creature within range that can hear you. Until the spell ends, while the target is on the same plane of existence as you, both you and the target are magically linked to each other. A creature can only be linked to one other creature at a time using this spell.

A creature can communicate with its link telepathically. Additionally, as an action, a creature can see through its link's eyes and hear what it hears until the start of the creature's next turn, gaining the benefits of any special senses that its link has, but it is blinded and deafened to its own surroundings.

If a creature casts a spell with a range of touch, its link can deliver the spell as if it had cast the spell. The creature's link must be within 100 feet of it, and the link must choose to use its reaction to deliver the spell when cast. If the spell requires an attack roll, the casting creature uses its attack modifier for the roll.

A linked creature can sever this magical link at any time, which ends the spell.

#### [Death's Departure](https://github.com/mpanighetti/dnd5e-spells/blob/main/4th-level/deaths-departure.md)

_4th-level abjuration/rhythmancy_

- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self (30-foot sphere)
- **Components:** V, S, M (a musical instrument worth at least 1 gp)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You perform a melody that repels the walking dead from your immediate vicinity. When an undead creature enters the spell's area of effect for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, a creature is Frightened of you for the duration of the spell (even if it is normally immune to the Frightened condition), or until it leaves the spell's area of effect. Creatures that are normally immune to the Frightened condition have advantage on this save.

On each of your turns, you must use your action to continue playing the song. The spell ends if you use your action to do anything else.

#### [Duet of Restoration](https://github.com/mpanighetti/dnd5e-spells/blob/main/2nd-level/duet-of-restoration.md)

_2nd-level evocation/rhythmancy (duet)_

- **Casting Time:** 1 minute
- **Range:** 10 feet (30-foot sphere)
- **Components:** V, S, M (a musical instrument worth at least 1 gp)
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

You and a partner play an uplifting duet, targeting a shared location within range. When the spell finishes casting, any creatures that remained within the spells' area of effect for the entire casting and were able to hear the entire composition gain the benefits of a short rest. A creature must complete a long rest before it can gain this benefit from this song again.

**At Higher Levels.** When you and your partner both cast this spell using spell slots of 3rd-level or higher, all creatures that gained the benefits of a short rest from this spell also gain a number of temporary hit points equal to twice the spells' combined levels; for example, if both spells are cast at 3rd-level, a creature gains 12 temporary hit points, or (3 + 3) Ã— 2.

#### [Earth God's Lyric](https://github.com/mpanighetti/dnd5e-spells/blob/main/4th-level/earth-gods-lyric.md)

_4th-level evocation/rhythmancy_

- **Casting Time:** 10 minutes
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V, S, M (a musical instrument worth at least 1 gp; a handful of soil from the Elemental Plane of Earth which the spell consumes)
- **Duration:** 8 hours

The notes you play resonate with the world under your feet, strengthening your bond to the earth. The spell can only take effect if you maintain contact with the ground the entire time you cast the spell, otherwise it fails.

Once you finish casting, until the spell ends, as long as you touch the ground, you cannot be unwillingly or forcibly removed from your location, as a magical gravitational pull holds you firm. This does not prevent you from being grappled, but a creature grappling you cannot separate you from the ground you stand on by any nonmagical means.

Magical effects that would lift or relocate you as forced movement, such as the _levitate_ spell, end immediately and cannot target you, unless they are cast as spells at a higher level than you cast this spell. Magical effects that manipulate you into moving yourself, such as a magical charm compelling you to use your own movement, function normally.

If a creature attempts to teleport or planeshift you against your will and they are not using a spell cast at a higher level than this spell, they must first succeed on a spellcasting ability check (or a Wisdom check if they do not have the ability to cast spells) contested by your spell save DC, or the teleport or planeshift fails to include you as a target.

If you are moved, teleported, or planeshifted against your will, this spell's effects are suspended until the relocation is complete, after which you are once again tethered to whatever ground you are touching. If you are successfully separated from the ground against your will for 1 minute or longer, the spell ends.

#### [Elegy of Emptiness](https://github.com/mpanighetti/dnd5e-spells/blob/main/2nd-level/elegy-of-emptiness.md)

_2nd-level conjuration/rhythmancy_

- **Casting Time:** 1 minute
- **Range:** 5 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a musical instrument worth at least 1 gp)
- **Duration:** Until dispelled

You create a duplicate of your body in the form of an empty shell in an unoccupied space within range. This shell is an inanimate object exactly your height, weight, physical size, and body shape. Its appearance is superficially similar to that of your body and facial appearance, as well as any clothing you were wearing and any equipment you were carrying when casting the spell, though this false equipment is part of the shell's form and is not removable. The shell appears to be made of a hard stone-like material when touched. Its false body is fixed in a rigid standing position with its appendages resting at its sides. The shell is indestructible.

A shell based on your form vanishes the next time you cast this spell, unless your body is in a different form when casting the spell (such as being shapeshifted or polymorphed), in which case a unique shell is created based on your different form. If you create a new shell and a number of shells up to your proficiency bonus already exist, the oldest shell vanishes.

#### [Equine Tribute](https://github.com/mpanighetti/dnd5e-spells/blob/main/1st-level/equine-tribute.md)

_1st-level conjuration/rhythmancy_

- **Casting Time:** 1 minute
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a sprig of horse grass; a musical instrument worth at least 1 gp)
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

You recant the tale of a great hero's beloved horse companion to endear yourself to a horse with an Intelligence score less than 10 within range; at the Game Master's discretion, you can target a creature other than a horse, as long as they are at least one size category larger than you and have an appropriate anatomy to serve as your mount. If the target is willing, is able to hear you, and remains within range for the entire casting of the spell, they are considered to be your companion.

A companion is your ally. In combat, they share your initiative count, and they function as a controlled mount (as defined in the rules on mounted combat). If you have the Incapacitated condition, your companion takes their turn immediately after yours and acts independently, focusing on protecting you. A creature can only be a companion to one other creature at a time.

When you cast this spell and already have a companion, instead of making a new companion, you can either teleport your companion to a location within range (or the nearest unoccupied space that can accommodate your companion), or send your companion within range to the last location you summoned them from.

If your companion is mistreated or harmed by you or any of your allies, or at their own discretion, they can choose to end their companionship to you, and you can similarly end this companionship at any time. If you already have a companion and target a new creature with this spell, the previous companionship ends. Otherwise, the companionship lasts until you or your companion dies.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell to summon your companion using a Spell Slot of 2nd-level or higher, they gain a number of Temporary Hit Points equal to five times the Spell Slot level.

#### [Frog's Song of Soul](https://github.com/mpanighetti/dnd5e-spells/blob/main/4th-level/frogs-song-of-soul.md)

_4th-level necromancy/rhythmancy_

- **Casting Time:** 1 hour
- **Range:** 20 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a musical instrument worth at least 1 gp; a gold crown worth at least 300 gp which the spell consumes unless the spell targeted or raised an undead creature)
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

You attempt to influence the life energy of a corpse or undead creature you can see within range. Make a spellcasting ability check. The target regains all of its hit points, then undergoes additional effects depending on the target and the result of your check:

- **If the target is a corpse that has been dead up to 1 year; the creature's soul is willing and able to rejoin the body; and the creature is not undead:** your spellcasting ability check is contested by a DC equal the target creature's Challenge or Level (minimum DC 10). If the check succeeds, the creature returns to life, any poisons and normal diseases that affected it are neutralized, and its mortal wounds are closed (but missing body parts are not restored).

   If the creature was afflicted by any magical diseases, curses, or similar effects when they died, and they weren't removed prior to casting this spell, they take effect when the creature returns to life. Furthermore, the target takes a âˆ’4 penalty to all attack rolls, saving throws, and ability checks. This penalty is reduced by 1 every time the target finishes a long rest, after which the penalty disappears.

   Until you finish a long rest, you can't cast spells again, and you have disadvantage on all attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws.

- **If the target is a corpse that has been dead for longer than 1 year; the soul was not returned to the body; the corpse is lacking body parts or organs integral for the creature's survival; or you fail on your spellcasting ability check (you can choose to fail this check):** the spell imbues the target with a foul mimicry of life, rejecting the corpse's original soul. A corpse targeted by this spell is raised using all of its original statistics except for the following changes: its creature type becomes undead; its alignment changes to evil; it gains immunity to necrotic and poison damage; and it gains immunity to exhaustion and being frightened, paralyzed, or poisoned. The spell magically substitutes any missing senses and abilities due to lacking body parts or organs, providing spectral replacements.

- **If the target is an undead creature, either when you initially cast this spell or when it died:** the target gains a number of temporary hit points equal to your spellcasting ability check.

An undead creature targeted or raised by this spell must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC, or it is charmed by you. On each of your turns, you can use a bonus action to mentally command any creature you charmed with this spell within 60 feet of you (if you control any combination of creatures using this spell or _animate dead_, you can command any or all of them at the same time, issuing the same or different commands to each one). You decide what action the creature will take and where it will move during its next turn, or you can issue a general command, such as to guard a particular chamber or corridor. If you issue no commands, the creature defends you and itself against hostile creatures, moving as needed and able to remain within at least 30 feet of you. Once given an order, the creature continues to follow it until its task is complete.

On a successful save, or if the charmed condition on the undead creature ends, the creature stops obeying any command you've given it and cannot be targeted by this spell again for the next 30 days.

#### [The Hawk's Call](https://github.com/mpanighetti/dnd5e-spells/blob/main/cantrips/the-hawks-call.md)

_Evocation/rhythmancy cantrip_

- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a sprig of hawk grass; a musical instrument worth at least 1 gp)
- **Duration:** 1 round

You play a series of sharp tones evoking the piercing cry of a bird of prey, summoning a spectral bird to slash its talons at a creature of your choice that you can see within range. The bird can take whatever form you choose, then makes a melee spell attack against the target. On a hit, the bird deals 1d4 piercing damage, and the target has disadvantage on Perception checks and Dexterity saving throws it makes before the end of its next turn as the bird flies in its face to distract it. On a miss, or at the start of your next turn, the bird disappears, ending the spell.

The spell creates more than one bird when you reach higher levels: two birds at 5th-level, three birds at 11th level, and four birds at 17th-level. You can direct the birds at the same target or at different ones. Make a separate attack roll for each bird. The spell ends at the start of your next turn or if all the birds disappear.

#### [The Lost is Found](https://github.com/mpanighetti/dnd5e-spells/blob/main/1st-level/the-lost-is-found.md)

_1st-level divination/rhythmancy (ritual)_

- **Casting Time:** 1 minute
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V, S, M (a branch or leaf from a tree you've climbed; a musical instrument worth at least 1 gp)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour

You play a song to yourself that stirs old memories of a childhood friend. Until the spell ends, while you are traveling or exploring within the same environment you were in when casting the spell, you canâ€™t become lost except by magical means.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd-level or higher, the duration increases to a number of hours equal to the spell slot level. Additionally, until the spell ends, if magical effects cause you to become lost, as an action, you can attempt to identify a valid route to take for a specific intended destination on the same plane of existence as you. Make a spellcasting ability check contested by a DC equal to 10 + the other spell's level (or DC 15 if caused by another magical effect). On a success, the magical effects obfuscating your travel are suppressed for the duration of the spell, during which time the shortest and most direct route to your destination (but not necessarily the safest route) is drawn out as a spectral golden wire on the ground. On a failed check, the spell ends immediately.

#### [Melody of Darkness](https://github.com/mpanighetti/dnd5e-spells/blob/main/5th-level/melody-of-darkness.md)

_5th-level necromancy/rhythmancy_

- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self (30 foot sphere)
- **Components:** V, S, M (a musical instrument worth at least 1 gp)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You play a disturbing tune that drains the life energy of its listeners. All creatures other than yourself within 30 feet of you that can hear you must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become cursed for the duration of the spell. This spell has no effect on undead or constructs.

When you cast this spell, and on each of your turns for the spell's duration if you use your action, all creatures cursed by this spell that can hear you take 5d6 necrotic damage.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th-level or higher, creatures cursed by this spell take an additional 1d6 necrotic damage for each spell slot above 5th.

#### [Minute Minuet](https://github.com/mpanighetti/dnd5e-spells/blob/main/4th-level/minute-minuet.md)

_4th-level transmutation/rhythmancy_

- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a musical instrument worth at least 1 gp)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes

You attempt to diminish a creature you can see within range that can hear you. The target makes a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, until the spell ends, the target's size is reduced to one-fourth of normal in all dimensions, its weight is reduced to one-sixty-fourth of normal, and its size decreases by two categories (e.g. from Large to Small, minimum Tiny). On a successful save, the spell ends.

Everything the creature is wearing and carrying, including its weapons, changes size with it. Any item dropped by an affected creature returns to normal size at once.

While reduced in this manner, the target's speed is halved; it has disadvantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws; it loses any resistance or immunity it has to nonmagical damage; and all of its attacks using either natural weapons or any reduced weapons deal 3d6 less damage (this can't reduce the damage below 1).

The spell ends if you are unable to see the target.

#### [New Wave Bossa Nova](https://github.com/mpanighetti/dnd5e-spells/blob/main/3rd-level/new-wave-bossa-nova.md)

_3rd-level abjuration/rhythmancy_

- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self (10-foot sphere)
- **Components:** V (functions even if you are in an area affected by magical silence), S, M (a musical instrument worth at least 1 gp)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

Until the spell ends, you create a sphere of healing energy that negates the effects of magical silence, such as the _silence_ spell, and the effects of magical darkness. The sphere moves with you. Creatures within this sphere are immune to magical silence and magical darkness, and can speak, hear, see, and cast spells normally. Any spells or magical effects causing silence or darkness are not dispelled, but they cannot affect any creatures within the negating sphere. If the negating sphere is contained completely within an area of magical silence or magical darkness, any such magical sound or light stops at the edge of the sphere and cannot travel in or out of it.

#### [Oath to Order](https://github.com/mpanighetti/dnd5e-spells/blob/main/8th-level/oath-to-order.md)

_8th-level abjuration/rhythmancy_

- **Casting Time:** 8 hours
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V, S, M (a musical instrument worth at least 1 gp; a lock of hair from a creature larger than you of Challenge 6 or higher which the spell consumes)
- **Duration:** 30 days

You call upon the spirits of ancient giants to grant you the ability to repel massive bodies. The spell can only take effect if you maintain contact with the ground the entire time you cast the spell, otherwise it fails.

Until the spell ends, as an action, you can target a creature or object within 30 feet of you and attempt to repel it. The target must succeed on a Strength saving throw or it is forcibly shoved a distance of your choice up to 100 feet away from you in a straight line and knocked prone. If the target is a creature that is already prone, it is additionally stunned until the end of your next turn.

Manipulating gravity and mass in this manner takes a physical toll on your body. Each time you attempt to repel a creature, at the end of your turn, you must succeed on a Constitution saving throw contested by your own spell save DC or suffer one level of exhaustion.

#### [Peaceful Lullaby](https://github.com/mpanighetti/dnd5e-spells/blob/main/3rd-level/peaceful-lullaby.md)

_3rd-level enchantment/rhythmancy_

- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** V, M (a musical instrument worth at least 1 gp)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour

You play a gentle melody in an attempt to lull a creature that can hear you in range. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or fall asleep and remain unconscious until the spell ends, it takes damage, or another creature takes an action to wake it. Constructs and undead automatically succeed on this saving throw.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th-level or higher, for each spell slot above 3rd, the duration increases by 1 hour, and you can target an additional creature.

#### [The River Devil's Lament](https://github.com/mpanighetti/dnd5e-spells/blob/main/6th-level/the-river-devils-lament.md)

_6th-level enchantment/rhythmancy_

- **Casting Time:** 1 minute
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a musical instrument worth at least 1 gp; water from a river that flows backward which the spell consumes)
- **Duration:** 8 hours

You recite the tale of an ancient hero who drove away a great evil, in order to instill lasting terror in a creature you can see within range that can hear you. That creature must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the target is cursed. While cursed in this manner, the creature is frightened of you, and if the creature can see you at the start of its turn, it takes 3d10 psychic damage. This cursed fright ignores immunity to the frightened condition, and persists even when the creature cannot see you, preventing the creature from moving toward your last known location.

Each time the creature takes damage (except from this spell's effects), it can repeat its saving throw, ending its curse on a success. You can additionally choose to end the curse by using an action to dismiss the spell. Otherwise, the creature remains cursed for the duration of the spell.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th-level or higher, the duration increases to 1 day (7th-level), 30 days (8th-level), or 1 year (9th-level), and the psychic damage dealt when the creature can see you increases by 1d10 for each spell slot level above 6th. Additionally, when you cast this spell at 8th-level or higher, the creature can no longer repeat its saving throws when it takes damage.

#### [Royal Duet](https://github.com/mpanighetti/dnd5e-spells/blob/main/3rd-level/royal-duet.md)

_3rd-level evocation/rhythmancy (duet)_

- **Casting Time:** 10 minutes
- **Range:** 10 feet (30-foot sphere)
- **Components:** V, S, M (a musical instrument worth at least 1 gp)
- **Duration:** 8 hours

You and a partner play an empowering duet, targeting a shared location within range. When the spell finishes casting, any creatures who remained within the spells' area of effect for the entire casting and were able to hear the entire composition have advantage on a single d20 test of their choice that they make within the spells' duration.

**At Higher Levels.** When you and your partner both cast this spell using spell slots of 4th-level or higher, for each spell level above 3rd, all creatures who gained advantage on a d20 test also gain a +1 to the roll. If the spells are cast at different levels, use the lower of the two levels. For example, if the spell is cast using a 5th-level and a 6th-level spell slot, creatures would gain the bonus from the 5th-level spell slot, which would be a +2 to their roll.

#### [Royal Lullaby](https://github.com/mpanighetti/dnd5e-spells/blob/main/cantrips/royal-lullaby.md)

_Enchantment/rhythmancy cantrip_

- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 10 feet
- **Components:** V, M (a petal from a silent princess flower; a musical instrument worth at least 1 gp)
- **Duration:** 1 minute

Playing this soothing melody historically indicated a connection to the royal family. Until this spell ends, you are considered to be proficient in all Charisma checks used to socially interact with creatures within range that heard you cast the spell.

Your temporary proficiency in these Charisma checks is further strengthened when you reach higher levels: your proficiency bonus is doubled at 5th-level, tripled at 11th level, and quadrupled at 17th-level.

#### [Sonata of Awakening](https://github.com/mpanighetti/dnd5e-spells/blob/main/2nd-level/sonata-of-awakening.md)

_2nd-level abjuration/rhythmancy_

- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** V, M (a musical instrument worth at least 1 gp, a bell worth at least 5 gp)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You stir slumbering creatures with rousing music. When you cast this spell, choose up to three creatures within range under the effect of magical sleep that can hear you. The targets, as well as all other naturally unconscious creatures within range that can hear you, immediately regain consciousness. Until the spell ends, magic can't put creatures within range to sleep, as long as they can still hear you.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd-level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each slot level above 2nd.

#### [Song of Discovery](https://github.com/mpanighetti/dnd5e-spells/blob/main/2nd-level/song-of-discovery.md)

_2nd-level divination/rhythmancy (ritual)_

- **Casting Time:** 1 minute
- **Range:** Self (20-foot sphere)
- **Components:** V, S, M (a musical instrument worth at least 1 gp, a magnifying glass worth at least 10 gp)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes

You perform a tune that disrupts any concealing magic in the vicinity. Until the spell ends, as an action, you can attempt to reveal invisible creatures and objects within your spell's area of effect. Make a spellcasting ability check. If there is a spell causing invisibility in your spell's area of effect, the DC equals 10 + the most powerful such spell's level in the area, or if the only invisibility present is caused by another magical effect, the DC is 15. On a success, all magical invisibility in the area of effect is dispelled, and this spell ends immediately. On a failure, or if there is no such magical invisibility nearby, your spell continues, but you gain no special insight into whether this outcome occurred due to failing the check or no viable invisible creatures or objects being nearby.

#### [Song of Healing](https://github.com/mpanighetti/dnd5e-spells/blob/main/5th-level/song-of-healing.md)

_5th-level evocation/rhythmancy_

- **Casting Time:** 1 minute
- **Range:** Self (30-foot sphere)
- **Components:** V, S, M (a musical instrument worth at least 1 gp)
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

You channel healing energies through soothing music. All creatures that remain within 30 feet of you for the entire casting time, except for undead or constructs, regain 5d10 hit points and are cured of blindness, deafness, and any diseases affecting them.

The healing energy attempts to soothe the restless undead and allow them to move on from this world. Each undead creature within the spell's area of effect when it is finished casting must make a Wisdom saving throw (it can choose to fail this save). On a failed save, the creature is reduced to 0 hit points, its spirit moves on to the afterlife, and its remains are destroyed in a burst of radiant fire. Creatures that are immune to being turned are not affected by this spell.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th-level or higher, the healing increases by 1d10 for each slot level above 5th.

When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th-level or higher, the spell also ends all curses affecting creatures healed by this spell. If any of those creatures are attuned to a cursed magic item, its curse remains, but the spell breaks its owner's attunement to the object so it can be removed or discarded.

#### [Song of Passing](https://github.com/mpanighetti/dnd5e-spells/blob/main/5th-level/song-of-passing.md)

_5th-level illusion/rhythmancy_

- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a musical instrument worth at least 1 gp)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour

You attempt to manipulate the apparent flow of time for a creature you target in range that can hear you. The target must make an Intelligence saving throw. If you are fighting the creature, it has advantage on the saving throw. On a failed save, until the spell ends, the target believes that time has passed such that it is either just after sunrise or just after sunset (whichever is the sooner of the two events).

While under the effects of this spell, the creature's senses are modified to convince it of the false time of day. The target's vision makes it appear as if environments are lit by sunlight for a false daytime, or darkened by night for a false nighttime. Any other time-sensitive visuals and sounds (such as a clock's face or a rooster's morning crow) are overlaid with appropriate illusory replacements. The creature is able to see in its illusory environment based on its existing senses as if the illusions are real; for example, a creature with sunlight sensitivity suffers disadvantage on checks that rely on sight while under false daylight conditions of this spell, and a creature with darkvision similarly would be able to see in false nighttime conditions as if it were actually dark. Creatures without darkvision are granted it temporarily to allow them to see in dark exteriors as if they were lit by daylight.

False memories are implanted in the creature's mind, such that it believes time and events have passed normally. Modified senses and memories don't necessarily affect how a creature behaves, but the creature will make normal efforts to proceed with activities that would make sense for the given time of day. Such activities might include leaving home to work a farm, closing a business for the night, departing for a formal occasion, preparing for bed, or any other time-specific course of action.

After the spell ends, the creature becomes aware that its senses and memories were altered by magic.

#### [Song of Storms](https://github.com/mpanighetti/dnd5e-spells/blob/main/1st-level/song-of-storms.md)

_1st-level evocation/rhythmancy_

- **Casting Time:** 1 minute
- **Range:** 120 feet (1 mile if cast outdoors)
- **Components:** V, S, M (a pebble or stone worn smooth by water used to forecast rainy weather; a musical instrument worth at least 1 gp)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour

You summon a storm cloud that is 10 feet tall with a 20-foot radius, centered on a point you can see within range directly above you. The spell fails if you canâ€™t see a point in the air where the storm cloud could appear (for example, if you are in a room that canâ€™t accommodate the cloud).

Until the spell ends, light rain falls in the area underneath the cloud. Invisible creatures under the cloud have disadvantage on attempts to hide as the rain patters on their bodies and reveals their locations as an outline of raindrops. The cloud moves with you.

If you are outdoors in a light rain when you cast this spell, the spell affects the existing storm instead of creating a new cloud. Under such conditions, the storm becomes a heavy rain, causing the area to be lightly obscured, extinguishing open flames, and imposing disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight or hearing. When the spell ends, the weather gradually returns to normal.

#### [Song of Time](https://github.com/mpanighetti/dnd5e-spells/blob/main/1st-level/song-of-time.md)

_1st-level abjuration/rhythmancy_

- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V, S, M (a musical instrument worth at least 1 gp)
- **Duration:** 10 minutes

You adjust the flow of time around you, granting you the ability to correct a recent mistake. Until this spell ends, if you fail on an attack roll, ability check, or saving throw, as a reaction, you can immediately roll a d20 and take the greater of the two results. The first time you fail a check using this spell effect, the spell ends.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd-level or higher, the duration increases to a number of hours equal to half the spell's level.

If desired, you can alter the performance of the Song of Time to a related composition to create one of the following effects, which replace the spell's normal 1st-level effects:

##### [Song of Double Time](https://github.com/mpanighetti/dnd5e-spells/blob/main/1st-level/song-of-time.md#song-of-double-time)

**Song of Double Time (3rd-level or higher).** By playing the Song of Time twice as fast, you move yourself to a moment in the near future, bypassing current events. Select any moment in time in the future up to the end of the spell's duration. You temporarily vanish from existence. At the moment in time you selected when casting the spell, you reappear in the same space from where you vanished, or in the nearest location if that space is occupied. From your perspective, no time has passed. When you reappear, the spell ends.

##### [Inverted Song of Time](https://github.com/mpanighetti/dnd5e-spells/blob/main/1st-level/song-of-time.md#inverted-song-of-time)

**Inverted Song of Time (5th-level or higher).** By playing the Song of Time in reverse, you anchor yourself to a moment in time, allowing yourself to complete more tasks in a short time period. Until the spell ends, your speed is doubled, you gain +2 to your AC, you have advantage on Dexterity saving throws, and you gain an additional action on each of your turns.

#### [Space Warp](https://github.com/mpanighetti/dnd5e-spells/blob/main/4th-level/space-warp.md)

_4th-level conjuration/rhythmancy (ritual)_

- **Casting Time:** 10 minutes
- **Range:** 10 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a musical instrument worth at least 1 gp; an object that was present when the target creature lost consciousness at the spell's destination which the spell consumes)
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

You play a prolonged melody, targeting a willing creature you can see within range and concentrating on a location where the target creature previously was unconscious, including due to normal or magical sleep. Space then shifts around the target creature, causing it to teleport to a safe location on the outskirts or outside the entrance to your destination.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th-level or higher, you can teleport an additional willing creature you can see within range to the destination for each slot level above 5th-level. When multiple creatures are targeted by this spell, you can choose a destination where any of the target creatures were unconscious, and the casting time increases by 10 minutes for each additional creature you target beyond the first.

#### [Summoning of the Scarecrow](https://github.com/mpanighetti/dnd5e-spells/blob/main/1st-level/summoning-of-the-scarecrow.md)

_1st-level conjuration/rhythmancy_

- **Casting Time:** 1 minute
- **Range:** 120 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a handful of straw; a musical instrument worth at least 1 gp)
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

A Medium-sized inanimate scarecrow appears anchored to the ground in an unoccupied space you can see within range. The destination must have at least enough space to accommodate the scarecrow, or the spell fails.

The scarecrow can act as a target for a thrown grappling hook or similar equipment, and it can support up to 500 pounds of weight. It disappears when you cast this spell again.

#### [Tune of Ages](https://github.com/mpanighetti/dnd5e-spells/blob/main/7th-level/tune-of-ages.md)

_7th-level conjuration/rhythmancy_

- **Casting Time:** 1 hour
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a magic item or a willing creature from the destination time period; a musical instrument worth at least 1 gp)
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

You and up to eight willing creatures within range are removed from your current time period and appear in the same physical location in another time period you choose.

The selected time period must at least specify the destination year, but can be more specific if desired. Additionally, the magic item or willing creature specified in the spell's material components must have existed in the time period you specify and must accompany you in the time travel. If any of these conditions are not met, the spell fails.

#### [Tune of Currents](https://github.com/mpanighetti/dnd5e-spells/blob/main/5th-level/tune-of-currents.md)

_5th-level abjuration/rhythmancy_

- **Casting Time:** 1 minute
- **Range:** 10 feet
- **Components:** V, M (a musical instrument worth at least 1 gp; an item that tells time worth 200 gp which the spell consumes)
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

You attempt to restore the normal flow of time for a creature within range. This spell can potentially remove the following temporal effects from the target:

- Any spell or magical effect on the target that caused them to grow older or younger
- Any spell or magical effect that caused the target to be removed from their original time period
- The _haste_, _slow_, and _time stop_ spells

Any such spell with a spell level equal to or less than the level of the spell slot you used to cast Tune of Currents, any such spell for which you were originally the caster, and any such magical effect not caused by a spell, is dispelled, ending its effects immediately. A creature magically displaced from their original time period is immediately returned to their era, and all magical aging is removed.

For each spell of a level higher than the level of the spell slot you used with a temporal effect on the target, make an ability check using your spellcasting ability. The DC equals twice the spell's level. On a successful check, the spell's effect on the target ends.

#### [Tune of Echoes](https://github.com/mpanighetti/dnd5e-spells/blob/main/3rd-level/tune-of-echoes.md)

_3rd-level divination/rhythmancy (ritual)_

- **Casting Time:** 1 minute
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V, S, M (a musical instrument worth at least 1 gp, a harp string spun from gold worth 25 gp)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes

You create an image in the air 10 feet in front of you depicting your current general location from a previous point in time. When you cast the spell, you decide whether the spell depicts a moment of historical significance, or a more specific moment in time you specify. If a moment of historical significance is selected, the Game Master picks the moment to depict, and if no historically significant moment has occurred in this location, the GM can depict any other moment in the past for the same location. If you pick a specific moment, you can be as vague or concrete as you like in your description of the moment, and the spell will attempt to reasonably carry out your request.

For the duration of the spell, the image plays out the selected moment in real time. The image can display any location within 100 feet of where the spell was cast, switching focus as needed to depict the selected moment as fully as possible. You can see and hear through the image as if you were present at that point in time. If, at any point during the playback of the selected moment, a magical effect was present which blocked detection through divination magic or being perceived through magical scrying sensors (such as with the _nondetection_ spell), the image becomes unfocused and the sound becomes distorted until such a time that the magical effect ended or was not present.

Any number of times before the spell ends, as an action, you can spend an additional spell slot of any level to extend the spell's duration by a number of minutes equal to ten times the slot level.

#### [Wind God's Aria](https://github.com/mpanighetti/dnd5e-spells/blob/main/4th-level/wind-gods-aria.md)

_4th-level evocation/rhythmancy_

- **Casting Time:** 10 minutes
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V, S, M (a musical instrument worth at least 1 gp; a vial of air from the Elemental Plane of Air which the spell consumes)
- **Duration:** 8 hours

The notes you play resonate with the air around you, lifting you upward and granting you free movement.

Until the spell ends, you gain a flying speed equal to your movement speed, or if you already have a flying speed, it is increased by 30 feet. You hover in place when you are not flying.

As long as you are not touching the ground, the air pulses around your body, granting you advantage on checks you make to resist being grappled or to escape a grapple. If you succeed on such a check, as a reaction, you can immediately move up to half your flying speed away with a burst of wind, and the creature that was grappling you must succeed on a Strength saving throw against your spell save DC or they are knocked prone. This movement doesn't provoke opportunity attacks.

If you are successfully forced to the ground against your will for 1 minute or longer, the spell ends.

#### [Wind's Requiem](https://github.com/mpanighetti/dnd5e-spells/blob/main/3rd-level/winds-requiem.md)

_3rd-level conjuration/rhythmancy (ritual)_

- **Casting Time:** 1 action

- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour

You create an unnatural strong wind at your back, overriding any existing wind direction affecting you. Until the spell ends, your jumping distance is tripled, and while you are on the deck of a sailing ship, it moves as if it is sailing with the wind. While concentrating on this spell, at the end of each of your turns, you can select a new direction for the winds around you to blow.

While concentrating on this spell, as an action, you can attempt to channel this magical wind to carry yourself and jump up to your jumping distance without using any movement. Make a Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check and add your spellcasting ability modifier, contested by a DC equal to one-sixth the number of feet you are attempting to jump (minimum DC 10, maximum DC 25). On a success, if there is level ground with enough space to accommodate you, you land safely at your intended destination. If there is insufficient space to land safely at your intended jump distance, you fall short in a safe space of your choice. On a failure, or if there is no eligible space to land safely in your path, your jump falls short a number of feet equal to your Athletics or Acrobatics check, and you fall prone. Whether you succeed or fail, the spell ends immediately.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th-level or higher, your jumping distance is multiplied by the spell slot number. For example, casting this spell at 4th-level would cause your jumping distance to be quadrupled.
