# Chapter 1: Learning Rhythmancy Spells

Rhythmancy songs are primarily passed down from teacher to student, or are sometimes buried with their creators and forgotten for centuries before being rediscovered by later explorers. The discovery of a composition infused with rhythmantic magic is often a world-changing event, unlocking access to long-forgotten secrets. On some worlds, rhythmancy is a completely unknown school of study.

## Who Can Learn Rythmancy

What separates rhythmancy spells from others is an intrinsic attachment to musical composition and performance as a channeling force.

Bards are naturally suited for learning rhythmancy magic and can learn any such spells through their normal spellcasting options, as they carry on a long tradition of passing secret songs of power down through the ages from their tutors to their future apprentices. Additionally, subclass and feat options are available in this document that provide direct access to some rhythmancy spells.

Any other magically inclined student can potentially learn rhythmantic magic they come upon if they meet the following requirements:

- They must already be able to cast a spell of the same level or higher using a feature or trait.
- They must have Proficiency in an instrument.
- They must either be taught by someone else who knows rhythmantic songs, or they must find a written copy of the spell and teach themself.

### Optional: Rhythmancy Spells for Other Classes

By default, rhythmantic magic is only available on the bard spell list, through special feats, or through training or self-teaching when a rhythmancy spell is discovered. However, the Dungeon Master can optionally make any or all rhythmancy spells available for spellcasters if they wish. If the DM allows, anyone with the Spellcasting or Pact Magic feature, or a feat that allows learning a spell, could potentially learn rhythmancy as a spell option using these features, as long as they also have Proficiency in an instrument. With this option, the rhythmancy spell is learned in place of the existing spell when the feature is gained.

## Rhythmantic Training

If a student is able to find a willing teacher who knows rhythmancy spells, and they meet all the requirements for learning the rhythmantic song, they can be taught the spell with time and practice.

Learning a rhythmancy spell from a teacher involves 2 workweeks of training per spell level or for a cantrip, and costs 25 gp per workweek. The time and gold represents the cost of materials involved in writing liner notes, copying the spell to the student's songbook, and maintaining and repairing their instrument as they learn to channel the raw musical power.

At the end of the training period, the song is added to the student's known spells as a rhythmancy spell.

### Self-Teaching

If a rhythmancy spell is written out on a spell scroll or as sheet music, anyone who meets all the requirements to learn the rhythmantic song can do so by practicing the composition and teaching themself. This bypasses the requirement for an instructor, but as a tradeoff for not having the guidance of a teacher, the number of workweeks required is doubled. Once per workweek, the student can attempt to remove that week's training costs by succeeding on a DC 15 Charisma (Performance) check. This check represents practicing the rhythmantic composition in front of crowds in local taverns as you perfect your understanding of the performative magic. On a failed check, in addition to the normal costs of learning your rhythmantic spell, roll on the **Rhythmantic Training Issues** table.

##### Rhythmantic Training Issues
| d6 | Issue |
|:--:|:------|
| 1  | The rhythmantic song's magic accidentally activates, targeting a random patron with the spell's effects. |
| 2  | A drunken brawl breaks out during your performance and you're blamed for inciting a public disturbance. The venue demands 50 gp payment for damages before allowing you to continue practicing there. |
| 3  | The rhythmantic song's magic manifests as a destructive thunderous burst of energy. You cast _thunderwave_ toward the audience. |
| 4  | Your underwhelming performance has resulted in reduced attendance, giving you disadvantage on Charisma (Performance) checks used in the next 1d4 attempts to remove training costs. |
| 5  | A regular attendee of your shows appears to be taking detailed notes of your rhythmantic composition in an attempt to copy it. |
| 6  | A drink stain on your songbook has smeared your notes, making them illegible. Add 1 workweek to the total required for learning the rhythmancy song as you recreate your notes. |

## Adding Rhythmancy Spells

Depending on how they use magic normally, a student can add rhythmantic songs they have successfully learned to their known spells using one of three options: as a class spell using the Spellcasting or Pact Magic feature (**option 1**); through another feature that allows casting spells (**option 2**); or through a trait that grants the ability to cast a spell (**option 3**).

1. **If you have the Spellcasting or Pact Magic feature and have spell slots of the same level or higher:** The rhythmancy spell is added to your list of known class spells. If you have Spellcasting or Pact Magic from multiple classes, pick one class under which you learn all rhythmantic magic. You can change this selection any time you gain a level, as long as the class you choose is also able to cast spells at a level equal to or higher than the highest-level rhythmancy spell you know.

2. **If you have another class feature or feat that grants the ability to cast a spell of the same level or higher:** The rhythmancy spell is made available as an alternative spell using this feature.

3. **If you have a species trait that grants the ability to cast a spell of the same level or higher:** The rhythmancy spell is made available as an alternative spell using this trait.

You must use the first option available to you based on your class levels, features, traits, and the rhythmancy spell's level and casting requirements. If the spell is added under option 2 or 3 and a higher option is made available later (such as gaining the Spellcasting feature), all your compatible rhythmancy spells immediately move to the highest-available option. If none of these options are available, you cannot learn the spell. If you lose access to all your options later (such as the _reincarnate_ spell changing you into a creature lacking the ability to cast spells), you retain the knowledge of your rhythmancy spells but are unable to cast them unless you regain compatible spellcasting options later.
